Steps for making plots

1. Figure out what sort of plot you want
2. Decompose your idea so you can assemble it.
3. If you need help,
  * `?` in R (`?geom_bar`)
  * [ggplot2 documuentation](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/)
4. If you get stuck on one part of the plot,
    skip it and work on other parts of the plot.

ggplot2 is said to be an implementation of the
Grammar of Graphics. What's the Grammar of Graphics?
We'll talk about that in the afternoon.
