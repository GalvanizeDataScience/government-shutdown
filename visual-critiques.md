## 1. A good data visual

I liked this visual because the topic matter is funny and interesting, but especially because of the inset visualization
which examines a possible source of error in the interpretation and 'normalizes' the sightings for population density.

## 2. A bad data visual

This graphic depicts major categories of causes of death in the 20th century. The data doesn't really enlighten for 
multiple reasons, such as that it depicts proximate causes of death (eg if somebody dies of infectious disease, to what 
degree did they die of lack of health care access) or that 'old age' is not listed. And the meandering design does not
lend itself to comprehensive understanding. It's just kinda pretty.


## 3. A good non-data visual

This does use some data but in a very simplistic way. Also, it's not really a visual (so I cheated a little). But I think
it exemplifies the basic purpose of visualization because it makes data personal and relevant. Despite being extremely
simple it conveys a significant change in thinking.
